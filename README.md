# Project4

In this project you play as the little knight guy, you move left and right with A and D and jump with W
You want to collect bottles (There are 3 on the map and you win after 3)

You die if you fall in lava or get touched by one of the enemies (Flying Slimes)

This is how it satifies the requirements
1) The world blocks, and backround are both tile sets
2) The Play character moves as specified
3) The player character and enemies have animation - the player character has idle and moving - enemy only has moving as it is always moving
4-7) Enemies pathfind with 2D navigation as specifed
8) There are particle effects on picking up the bottle - and on the lava, and in the snow mountain
9-10) physics and collisions exist
11) You try to collect 3 bottles, which are tracked on the text at the start
12) gravity and jumping exists
13) The only UI needed is the bottles listed at spawn - no need for health or a timer
14) I hope there is a good amount of polish and creativity!
